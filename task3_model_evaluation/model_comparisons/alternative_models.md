| Phi-3-Mini | 6/10 | 6/10 | 9/10 | 4/10 | 5.5/10 |

## Key Differentiators

### Why CodeT5+ Wins
1. **Best Balance**: Optimal trade-off across all criteria
2. **Educational Adaptability**: Easiest to customize for teaching
3. **Proven Track Record**: Extensive validation in educational contexts
4. **Practical Deployment**: Reasonable resource requirements
5. **Open Source Freedom**: Complete institutional control

### When Alternatives Might Be Better
- **Code Llama**: If computational resources are abundant and maximum capability needed
- **CodeBERT**: If only code analysis (not generation) is required
- **Phi-3-Mini**: If extremely limited hardware resources
- **WizardCoder**: If instruction-following is the primary requirement

## Selection Rationale Summary

**Primary Choice: CodeT5+**
- Specifically designed for code understanding
- Balanced architecture for educational needs
- Manageable deployment requirements
- Strong open-source ecosystem

**Backup Options:**
1. **Code Llama 7B** (if more resources available)
2. **CodeBERT** (if only analysis needed)
3. **Phi-3-Mini** (if resource constraints critical)

The evaluation confirms CodeT5+ as the optimal choice for student competence analysis, providing the best combination of technical capability, educational suitability, and practical feasibility.
