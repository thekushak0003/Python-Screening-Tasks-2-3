# Task 3: Open Source Models Research Plan

## Overview
Comprehensive research plan for evaluating open source AI models for student competence analysis in Python learning environments.

## Files Description
- `research_plan.md` - Core 2-paragraph research plan (main deliverable)
- `detailed_analysis.md` - Comprehensive model evaluation and selection rationale
- `reasoning_answers.md` - Detailed responses to all required reasoning questions
- `implementation_roadmap.md` - Practical 7-week deployment plan
- `evaluation_framework/` - Testing methodologies and success metrics
- `model_comparisons/` - Comparative analysis of candidate models

## Primary Recommendation: CodeT5+
After systematic evaluation, CodeT5+ emerges as the optimal balance of code understanding capability, educational applicability, and practical deployment feasibility.

## Research Innovation
This plan uniquely combines technical AI model evaluation with educational theory, ensuring selected models not only analyze code effectively but also promote genuine learning outcomes.
