# Task 2: AI Debugging Assistant Prompt

## Overview
This directory contains a comprehensive solution for creating an AI debugging assistant that helps students learn through guided discovery rather than direct solution provision. The approach implements Socratic teaching methodology to promote deeper learning and independent problem-solving skills.

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Innovation: Socratic Teaching Framework
Our approach treats the AI as a Socratic teacher who guides students to their own discoveries through strategic questioning, rather than providing direct solutions. This methodology is grounded in educational psychology research showing that self-discovered solutions lead to deeper understanding and better retention.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Description

### Core Deliverables
- **`debugging_prompt.txt`** - The complete prompt ready for use with any AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- **`reasoning_explanation.md`** - Detailed explanation of design choices and required reasoning answers
- **`skill_level_adaptations.md`** - Specific adaptations for beginner vs advanced learners

### Supporting Materials  
- **`examples/sample_interactions.md`** - Example conversations demonstrating the prompt in action

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Guide

1. **Copy the Prompt**: Take the content from `debugging_prompt.txt`
2. **Choose AI Platform**: Use with ChatGPT, Claude, or similar AI assistant
3. **Adapt for Skill Level**: Apply guidelines from `skill_level_adaptations.md` based on student competency
4. **Monitor Effectiveness**: Use examples in the examples folder to validate performance

## ðŸŽ¨ Key Features

### Pedagogical Design
- **Solution Prevention**: Multiple mechanisms to avoid giving away direct answers
- **Guided Discovery**: Strategic questioning that leads to student insights
- **Confidence Building**: Built-in encouragement and growth mindset promotion
- **Structured Responses**: 5-step framework ensuring consistent educational value

### Adaptive Capabilities
- **Beginner Support**: Simplified language, basic concept explanations, extra encouragement
- **Advanced Challenge**: Technical precision, architectural discussions, optimization considerations
- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Framework for adapting based on observed student competency

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

When properly implemented, this prompt should result in:
- Students discovering solutions independently rather than receiving them
- Increased engagement through curiosity-driven learning
- Development of debugging methodology, not just problem fixes
- Enhanced confidence in problem-solving abilities
- Improved retention of programming concepts

## ðŸ”§ Technical Requirements

- Compatible with any modern AI language model
- No additional setup or configuration required
- Works across different programming languages (optimized for Python)
- Scalable for classroom or individual use
